# React-Router-Bulma-Boilerplate
A boilerplate React web app created with react-create-app, Bulma CSS in /public, and React Router-DOM set up

### Installation

1. `git clone git@github.com:njwest/React-Router-Bulma-Boilerplate.git myapp && cd myapp`

2. `yarn install`

3. `yarn start`

#### Note about Yarn vs NPM

Since this app was created using react-create-app, use `yarn` commands (`yarn add`, `yarn start`, etc) instead of `npm` commands, as NPM will get confused and delete your yarn-installed packages whenever you `npm i` (quickly remedied by doing an `npm i`, but still annoying).
