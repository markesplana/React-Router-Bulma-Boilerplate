# React-Router-Bulma-Boilerplate
A boilerplate React web app created with react-create-app, Bulma CSS in /public, and React Router-DOM set up

Since this app was created using react-create-app, use `yarn` commands (`yarn add`, `yarn start`, etc) instead of `npm` commands, as NPM will get confused and delete your yarn-installed packages whenever you `npm i` (quickly remedied by doing an `npm i`, but still annoying).
